      DARKEN it. He doesn''t need food scraps to prove he ate something.'

  - text: 'Boss: The clerk waving behind him, BLUR out the receipt in his hand! Outrageous.
      Charging money for a single burger? How pathetic... We need to make it look
      like he is begging to shake Mr. Green''s hand. That is the highest honor of
      his life!'

  - text: 'Boss: The traffic light above his head? Jaywalking shows he is consumed
      by corporate affairs; he has no time to wait for lights. But to avoid giving
      people ammunition for gossip, change that red light to green.'

  - text: 'Boss: And that guy braking hard across the street? Unacceptable! Big Green
      is standing right there, and instead of detouring, he honks? He scared Mr.
      Green! Add some BLUR to the car. We can''t let it look like a panic stop.'
